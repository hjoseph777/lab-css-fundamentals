## CSS Exercise

This exercise involves working with the `styles5.css` file to style an HTML document. 


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the web page.
- `styles5.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the HTML elements.

## Key CSS Selectors

One of the key selectors used in `styles5.css` is:

```css
input[type="Username"], input[type="Name"], input[type="Password"], input[type="Email"], input[type="Tel"]
````

This selector targets input elements of various types and applies the same styles to them.

## Goals

- Understand how to use different CSS selectors to target HTML elements.
- Learn how to organize and manage CSS files.
- Experiment with different styles to see their effects on the web page.

Feel free to explore and modify the

styles5.css

file to enhance your understanding of CSS styling!
